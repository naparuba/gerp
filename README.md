# gerp
The grep command for those with two left (or right) hands

The gerp command is useful if you always miss the "grep" with "gerp". It will:
* give you an insult, because you failed
* will run the valid grep command

# Compile:
Just run:

    go build gerp.go

Then:

    cp -rp ./gerp /bin

You can now do the gerp error, it's no more a problem!

      case ${GRUB_DEVICE} in
    # and mounting btrfs requires user space scanning, so force UUID in this case.
      case x"$GRUB_FS" in
      case $type in
